It had lots of currencies from different countries and some were old. She gave me all of her collection. It inspired me to collect different currencies. Actually currencies are a piece of history which tell us how the people in olden times lived and what was their culture. I got the inspiration of reading books from my Mamu as he likes to read books. He also is a very intelligent person. I got the inpiration of researching by myself.</p></section><section id="Contacts"><h1>Contacts</h1><p>My email is gsdutta223@gmail.com. You can email me.
